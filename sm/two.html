Scrum encourages teams to learn through experiences, self-organise while working on a problem, and reflect on their wins and losses to continuously improve.
Scrum describes a set of meetings, tools, and roles that work in concert to help teams structure and manage their work.
Product owner prioritized a backlog of work for the team to do.
Every two weeks or so the team looks at the backlog and decides what they can accomplish in the next two weeks.
The team develops and tests solutions to the backlog items until done and ready for use.
At the end of the two weeks the team demonstrates its completed work to the product owner and stakeholders.
Finally, the team reflect on how things went during the two weeks and how it can improve.</p></div> <h2 id="scrum-roles"><a href="#scrum-roles" class="header-anchor">#</a> Scrum Roles</h2> <p>Scrum roles describe the key responsibilities of the team members. They are not be confused with job titles. The three roles provide a minimum definition of responsibilities and accountability to allow the team to effectively deliver work.
The three roles are Scrum Master, Product Owner, and Developer. These members can still have many different job titles in the company.
For example, the Scrum Master might help with development, and the Developers might help with leadership.</p> <h2 id="scrum-master"><a href="#scrum-master" class="header-anchor">#</a> Scrum Master</h2> <p>Protects the team and the process

We recommend 2 weeks per Sprint.</p> <div class="custom-block tip"><p class="custom-block-title">TIP</p> <h3 id="sprint-planning"><a href="#sprint-planning" class="header-anchor">#</a> Sprint Planning</h3> <p>The planning that takes place to determine what will be in your Sprint backlog. We recommend at least an hour. The work and how to accomplish it goes into the Sprint backlog. It is assigned to an owner.
Sprint planning is an event in scrum that kicks off the sprint. The purpose of sprint planning is to define what can be delivered in the sprint and how that work will be achieved. Sprint planning is done in collaboration with the whole scrum team. Set realistic goals by defining;</p></div> <h4 id="the-what"><a href="#the-what" class="header-anchor">#</a> The What</h4> <p>–  The product owner describes the objective(or goal) of the sprint and what backlog items contribute to that goal. The scrum team decides what can be done in the coming sprint and what they will do during the sprint to make that happen.</p> <h4 id="the-how"><a href="#the-how" class="header-anchor">#</a> The How</h4> <p>– The development team plans the work necessary to deliver the sprint goal. Ultimately, the resulting sprint plan is a negotiation between the development team and product owner based on value and effort.</p> <h4 id="the-who"><a href="#the-who" class="header-anchor">#</a> The Who</h4> <p>– Product Owner, Scrum Master, and Development team must attend. The product owner defines the goal based on the value that they seek. The development team needs to understand how they can or cannot deliver that goal. If either is missing from this event it makes planning the sprint almost impossible.</p> <h4 id="the-inputs"><a href="#the-inputs" class="header-anchor">#</a> The Inputs</h4> <p>– A great starting point for the sprint plan is the product backlog as it provides a list of ‘stuff’ that could potentially be part of the current sprint. The team should also look at the existing work done in the increment and have a view to capacity.</p> <h4 id="the-outputs"><a href="#the-outputs" class="header-anchor">#</a> The Outputs</h4> <p>– The most important outcome for the sprint planning meeting is that the team can describe the goal of the sprint and how it will start working toward that goal. The team agrees on an acceptance criteria for each task.</p> <div class="custom-block tip"><p class="custom-block-title">TIP</p> <h3 id="daily-scrum"><a href="#daily-scrum" class="header-anchor">#</a> Daily Scrum</h3> <p>A 15 minutes event to come together as a team to figure out the progress of the team towards the goal and to identify any blockers.
